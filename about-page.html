  <h1>About the Assembly</h1>
    <p><h4> The Greater Manchester Students' Assembly (GMSA) is a student body comprising of the five student' unions within Great Manchester. The elected executive teams of each students union make up the leadership of the GMSA. The formation of GMSA came through the desire for students to be adequately represented to the relevant bodies and to ensure that the student voice, which comprises such a larger proportion of Greater Manchester's citizens, was heard. GMSA strives for student interests to be taken into account, from health, to transport, to the daily realities of living within the city. Find out more about the members below:
